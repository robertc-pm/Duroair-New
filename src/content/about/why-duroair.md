  head: Duroair has designed and engineered the most flexible and efficient clean
    air systems in the market <strong>— the patented six-stage
    DuroPure™</strong> industrial air filtration system paired with <strong>the
    retractable DuroRoom™</strong> enclosure creates a lean manufacturing layout
    where it is needed.
  desc: Our plug-and-play modular system is designed to isolate processes in any
    work cell and filter hazards like hexavalent <br>chromium, isocyanates,
    dust, or VOCs, ensuring worker safety, saving time, and maximizing your
    bottom line.

    description_1: DuroRoom enclosures retract to provide easy access to overhead
      cranes. Say goodbye to costly moves and lengthy disruptions when moving
      oversized workpieces.

  heading_3: How The 6-Stage Airfiltration System Works
  description_3: >-
    **The first three stages** capture particulates, including hexavalent
    chromium and particulate isocyanates. The air filtration system places less
    <br> expensive filters in front of more expensive, technically-advanced
    filters to protect them and extend filter life.


    The third stage filter can be changed to accommodate Merv15, HEPA, NESHAP 319 standards, depending upon needs. This provides the <br> manufacturing flexibility to do different operations in the enclosure.
  air_stages:
    - heading_4: Stage 1
      description_4: captures particulates to 10 microns in size
    - description_4: captures particulates to 5 microns in size
      heading_4: Stage 2

      description_4: Stage 4
    - heading_4: Stage 6
      description_4: Stage 6
  description_5: The next three-stage gas filtration process includes
    photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) and UV light to separate and <br> destroy
    VOCs. Carbon adsorbs contaminants and UV light destroys VOCs.

ingenuity:
  title_1: Duroair's Engineering Ingenuity
  intro_desc: Duroair has taken its engineering ingenuity to a new level by
    designing a multi-chamber booth that **accommodates up to three separate
    clean-air operations at the same time.**
  heading_12: Flexible Setup Options to Cater Your Different Needs
  description_12: The three chambers can be used independently, or one or both of
    the interior curtains can be opened so that one or two functions can be
    performed. Easily prep, paint, or coat three workpieces at the same time!

  flexible_options:
    - heading_13: 1-1-1 ratio for three separate operations.
      description_13: In the case of prep work, painting, and coating, the workpiece
        is moved the shortest possible distance for the next function.
      image_9: /media/uploads/1-1-1-2.png
    - heading_13: 2-1 ratio for two operations.
      description_13: This can eliminate or reduce backlogs, especially since some
        functions require more time than others.
      image_9: /media/uploads/2-1.jpg
    - heading_13: 1 single operation in the entire space.
      description_13: This accommodates a larger workpiece, such as the wing of an
        aircraft, an entire wind turbine, or a large engine workpiece.
