    At Duroair, we’ve built a legacy for transforming air quality through
    customization. Need to do surfacing and coating without contaminating your
    other processes in the same indoor space? Want to reduce your footprint and
    eliminate the need to move workpieces? We’ll partner with you to learn your
    processes so we can customize a clean-air solution that will increase your
    efficiency while helping you provide a clean, safe, and productive working
    environment.


    From North America to Asia, Europe, and beyond, we're committed to customizing clean-air solutions to help customers like you:


    * Improve overall health and safety in lean manufacturing facilities.

    * Engineer [solutions](/solutions) to isolate, capture, and contain a wide variety of industrial processes.

    * Go [beyond EHS compliance](/about/beyond-compliance/) to maximize efficiency and productivity.

    description: >-
      Never satisfied with the status quo, we’re always searching for new
      technology and methods for purposeful innovation to help you create a
      clean-air competitive advantage.


      * **Hexavalent Chromium Protection:** Through independent testing, Duroair has verified that our exhaust systems meet or exceed NESHAP 319 standards by capturing and containing hexavalent chromium - allowing clean air to be recirculated back into the manufacturing space or vented outside.

      * **Dust Collection Innovation:** Because your employees are your most valuable assets, Duroair has developed DuroDust™, a dust collection system that provides a properly vented, regulated work area that limits employees' exposure to respirable silica, metal dust, and other particulates.

      * **Space-Saving Hinge Design:** Space efficiency is always a priority, so Duroair has created a new hinge design that does not impact the enclosure footprint and moves up in the vertical wall axis, while the building retracts to under 20 percent of its extended length.
  - heading: Creating Complex Containment Solutions
    description: >-
      Our customized, complex containment solutions are designed to isolate
      sanding and painting processes while protecting workers doing other types
      of MRO in the same indoor space.


      * **Fixed containment:** Duroair engineers both fixed, softwall containment solutions, as well as hardwall clean-air solutions. For example, DuroRoom™ Hardwall is designed to accommodate wider spans (over 65 feet) for large assemblies. Its modular walls are easy to move and reconfigure as needed for sub-assemblies.

      * **Portable containment:** The DuroRoom™ softwall enclosure is also available as a portable containment solution. It retracts to 20% of its extended length to accommodate overhead cranes and to save space when not in use. This portability addresses workflow and footprint problems that cost time and money,

      * **Plug and Play containment:** Our DuroDeployable™ is the generator-ready paint booth for rapid, Plug and Play deployment. We developed it by combining the DuroRoom softwall, retractable enclosure and the DuroPure™ air filtration system for safe, compliant spray operations in garrison or while deployed.

  - heading: Clean-Air Flexibility for Material Handling
    description: >-
      From submarine propulsion systems to aerospace and aviation components, we
      create flexible clean-air solutions that address material handling
      challenges. Here are a couple of examples.


      * **Preventing damage during material handling:** Rather than moving pieces into spray booths, prep areas, or clean rooms, Duroair customizes portable clean-air enclosures to isolate and move with each piece. This prevents costly damage that can happen from over-handling.

      * **Reducing equipment expenses:** In some cases, a portable containment solution allows you to take clean air to each workpiece, which can eliminate the need for expensive overhead cranes or conveyors to move workpieces.

      * **Increasing facility/labor ROI:** Time-consuming material handling can eat into your profits because it ties up facility floor space and labor. Duroair’s clean-air solutions can retract to store when not in use. This minimizes space and labor required for material handling, enabling you to take on additional, more profitable projects in-house.

  - heading: Patented Industrial Air Filtration Technology
    description: >-
      Complex containment requires multiple stages of industrial filtration to
      remove airborne contaminants that compromise workpiece surfaces and
      threaten safety. Now there’s a patented solution with the DuroPure™
      non-vented, six-stage filtration system. 


      * **DuroPure** is the world’s first, indoor air filtration system that goes beyond OSHA compliance to capture 99+% of airborne particulates like hexavalent chromium, VOCs, and isocyanates, and recirculates clean air back into the workspace.

      * This patented technology pairs with our **DuroRoom** containment systems to create a clean-air envelope around each workpiece, for a contaminant-free, portable workstation. It also pairs with our patented, Taper Draft Airflow technology that goes beyond traditional cross drafts by creating indoor environments that are so clean, they exceed OSHA compliance requirements.

      * **DuroRoom** meets/exceeds CFM requirements, from 13,500 CFM to 200,000 CFM and beyond, to achieve airflow over 100 FPM at the intake filter face and ensure airflow remains below code requirements of 25% of the LEL (lower explosion limit). It’s also been tested by the Defense Centers for Public Health – Aberdeen (DCPH-A) and verified by Army Engineers and Industrial Hygienists.
