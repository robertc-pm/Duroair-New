  ### DuroCollector™ for Operational Flexibility


  From fine silica dust and tiny metal cutting particles to hexavalent chromium produced from grinding and blasting, DuroCollector™ continuously filters enormous volumes of submicronic dust particles that can threaten employee safety and productivity. With manual or automatic pulse cleaning settings, you have the flexibility to choose when dust trays need to be emptied based on shift changes or staff availability.  


  The DuroCollector™ dust collection system is:


  * Mobile and compact for quickly installing when and where you need it to improve air quality, without disrupting current workflows

  * Flexible for isolating and capturing contaminants when paired with our [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) enclosure to shield cellular manufacturing processes

  * Easy to clean, thanks to a more efficient vertical filter design for quick dust drawer collection, compared to cumbersome horizontal cartridge configurations
