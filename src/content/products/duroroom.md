  description: >-
    The DuroRoom™ portable workstation is custom-engineered to accommodate any
    workspace and any workpiece. It retracts to 20% of its extended length to
    accommodate use of an overhead crane and facilitate material handling or
    save space when not in use. DuroRoom retractable enclosures are used for
    painting and coating, clean rooms, isolation rooms, anterooms or gowning
    rooms and non-destructive testing environments. Most DuroRooms retract but
    fixed rooms are also available. Sizes up to 50’ high x 65’ wide x any linear
    length.

      Quick seals are used to penetrate the vinyl covering and allow mechanicals to enter the enclosure (for air, electrical requirements, etc.).

      <!--StartFragment-->


      The fire suppression system in DuroRoom is designed by Kidde Badger and protects both exhaust systems and the enclosure. This design moves with the enclosure as it extends and retracts. For non-retracting DuroRooms, wet fire suppression systems can be used.
