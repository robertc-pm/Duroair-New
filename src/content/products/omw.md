  ### OMW Series Filtration System


  Unlike traditional oil mist collectors with overpriced centrifugal filters,
  cartridges, and electrostatic precipitators, the OMW’s streamlined
  multi-filtration process quickly and effectively separates solid particulates
  in oil and water and captures oil for reuse.


  Duroair has completely reinvented the oil mist collection process for a more
  cost-effective containment solution to effectively improve health, safety, and
  productivity.


  The OMW ambient capture solution:


  * Requires no ductwork, so it won’t interfere with overhead cranes or other
  obstructions that cause trouble for existing ventilation systems

  * Reduces noise levels with an integrated silencer by decreasing static
  pressure

  * Adjusts via Clarion® unit nozzles to create airflow patterns that work best
  in your facility

technical_specifications: >-
  * Equipped with four different CFM models and one-to-four-year filter life to
  handle high pressure fluids and smoke and mist

  * Requires no ladders for easy-access maintenance

  * Comes standard with VFD and fluid pump

  * Recycles expensive fluids with self draining and cleaning functionality

  * Traps oil and particles via the first wicking stage

  * Drains these particles down into the sump located below the filter at state
  of saturation

  * Pumps oil mist away for reuse or disposal

  * Filters out finer mist and smoke particles in second wicking stage

  * Captures the remaining smallest particulate down to 0.30 microns in third
  stage wicking

  * Discharges clean air from the top of the collector into the facility
