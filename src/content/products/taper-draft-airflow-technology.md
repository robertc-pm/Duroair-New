  ### How Taper Draft Airflow Technology Works


  When paired with [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) and Duroair’s air filtration
  technology, our Taper Draft Airflow Technology pulls enormous volumes of clean
  air through an intake filter. Once the air is inside the enclosure, it
  continues to flow into the filter to create a clean air chamber that is
  impervious to contamination.


  #### Features & Benefits


  * Prevents contamination from corrosive dust and hazardous fumes that can
  threaten employee safety and reduce the lifespan of valuable machinery

  * Speeds up drying times for water-based paints and coatings without the use
  of additional quick-dry agents

  * Contains overspray by pulling the particles directly into the tapered
  filtration chamber, so the particles don’t settle on the workpiece, shop
  floor, paint booth, or anywhere that can impair quality control

  * Reduces operating costs via energy savings compared to inefficient cross
  drafts used in traditional air purification systems

  * Improves productivity by reducing downtime previously spent cleaning dusty
  floors and dirty, clogged machinery

  * Tapered airflow focuses the air down the center of the enclosure and over
  the work piece with almost no airflow down the walls, ceiling or floor 

  * Allows for the optimal capture of overspray and reduces any dust or dirt
  transfer

  * Creates a wicking process that decreases dry times

  * Exhaust system creates a negative pressure vacuum seal, creating a clean
  purified environment

  * Ideal for a retractable clean room and/or containing airborne particulates
  and chemicals
