    DuroCap™ is the vented, modular, air filtration system that’s easily
    customizable for extracting dusts, fumes, and gasses, creating a clean-air
    envelope around your oversized work pieces. Its 2-stage filtration removes
    99.4% of all air pollutants for a contaminant free portable workstation
    during sanding, grinding, [coating and
    painting](https://www.duroair.com/solutions/painting-coating/).




    Pair it with:




    * [DuroRoom™](https://www.duroair.com/products/duroroom) to create a clean air envelope around workpieces for a contaminant free retractable work station.

    * Single phase 220V and three phase 208/230/460/575V available upon request.

    * Built-in air regulation control with production air interlocked/ fans for safety.

    * Exhaust system creates a negative pressure vacuum seal around the DuroRoom to ensure no contaminants or VOCs are released into the main work environment and are directed through the exhaust system’s filters to the exterior.

    * Non-sparking aluminum blades, sized 12” to 60”, with 1/2hp to 10hp motors dependent on required airflow.

    * Pairs with enclosure made of a durable fire rated PVC vinyl meeting the requirements of NFPA 701.

    * System exhausts air to the exterior and requires ducting and make-up air.

new_key_features:
  - description: Comes fully assembled with a pre-wired control panel (lockable
      fused disconnect and C/UL/US Listed). Combined with a DuroRoom, the system
      depending upon size, can be installed in two to three days with a small
      crew.
    heading: Easy Assembly
  - description: Directs air down the center of the enclosure to maximize control of
      overspray, keep the sidewalls clean, and speed drying time.
    heading: Taper Draft Airflow Technology
  - description: Engineered airflow requirements from 13,500 CFM to 120,000 CFM and
      beyond, to achieve airflow over 100 FPM at the intake filter face and
      ensure airflow remains below code requirements of 25% of the LEL (lower
      explosion limit).
    heading: Meets/Exceeds CFM Requirements
  - description: Suitable for production painting and paints over 2.8 lbs VOCs per gallon.
    heading: Vented Solution
  - description: Energy-efficient VFD with adjustable air speeds, doubles as a soft
      starter to eliminate the need for a motor starter.
    heading: Variable Frequency Drive
  - description: Designed by Kidde Badger for protection of exhaust systems and the
      enclosure, while meeting NFPA 17 standards and is UL listed. Wet or dry
      systems are available depending upon requirements. Wet systems are for
      non-retracting only.

  heading: Clean Shop Air for the Entire Floor
  description: Welding toxic fumes and laser-cutting dust can threaten employee
    safety, derail productivity, and place you directly in the crosshairs of the
    EPA. Just a single spark can ignite welding “smoke” and endanger your entire
    shop floor. Welding contaminants can also reduce the life of your cooling
    fans and valuable CNC machinery.
