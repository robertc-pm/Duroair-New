  ### DuroTower™ Auto-Adjusting Plant Cleaning System


  From automotive repair and finishing to metal cutting and welding, industrial processes produce corrosive dust and fumes that can impair employee health and bring production to a grinding halt. DuroTower™ efficiently scoops up these contaminants in an intake downdraft and then floods the entire plant with clean air from the system outlet.


  A DuroTower™ air purification solution is:


  * Cost effective via its air revolver system that is ten times more energy efficient than traditional overhead cleaners

  * Flexible with multiple tower models that can be outfitted with casters to function as portable fume extractors

  * Environmentally compliant thanks to the air rotation technology that removes airborne particulates to 1 micron.

  * Cost effective via its air revolver system that is ten times more energy efficient than traditional overhead cleaners

  * Reduces energy costs through the de-stratification of heat layers, homogenizing air from floor to ceiling to within 5 degrees
