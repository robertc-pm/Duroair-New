    * Fans designed with reverse, incline fan wheels and inlet cones. Non-sparking constructed with fan sizes from 18" to 35" with 5hp to 25hp motors dependent on airflow requirements. Airflow designed at 3.5" static pressure.

    * Variable frequency drive (VF) gives complete control of airflow and doubles as a soft starter to eliminate the need for a motor starter.

    * Control panel is a lockable fused disconnect and is a C/UL/US listed panel, with an on/off, speed dial control. Prewired. Options include a customized HMI interface. Customer supplies building power.

    * Lighting options include C1D1, C1D2, LED lights and troffer lights, depending upon requirements.

    * Fire suppression: Wet or dry is available depending upon requirements. Wet for non-retracting only.
