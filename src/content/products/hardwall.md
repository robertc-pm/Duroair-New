    The DuroRoom™ Hardwall is a modular hardwall clean-air enclosure designed
    for large-capacity manufacturing and assemblies. Unlike prefab clean rooms,
    each [DuroRoom
    Hardwall](https://www.duroair.com/blog/custom-hard-wall-clean-room-solutions) is
    completely reconfigurable without sacrificing the durability of a permanent
    enclosure.


    Duroair can customize each hardwall clean room for a wide variety of manufacturing operations and MRO tasks. Whether you need custom temperature and humidity controls, positive or negative pressure particulates’ capture, or an ISO-classified clean room, each hardwall enclosure can be easily modified at any time for changing workflows or [aerospace assemblies](https://www.duroair.com/industries/aerospace-aviation). Metal-clad gypsum panels are easily washable and highly resistant to abrasion, impact, and most common chemicals. Standard height is 24’ but can go up to 50’ with unlimited width and length.

    * Standard DuroRoom Hardwall can go up to 24’H. Can go higher if required, up to 50’H.

    * Once installed, DuroRoom Hardwall can be taken apart and reconfigured as needed.

      * Panel systems: 2’’ void in wall for electrical, nitrogen lines, etc., is standard. Larger cavities are also available; can go up in increments of 3’’ (3’’, 6’’, 9”, etc.).
    * Roof panels are available in 3-6’’ thickness and are rated for up to 3 hours of fire resistance.

    * Metal-clad gypsum panels come in various sizes. Sizes available include 8’, 9’, 10’, 12’, 14’.

    * Self-supporting and braced buildings are available.

    * Option to be constructed 100% airtight. Covered corners are available if required for ISO-5 clean room requirements.

    * Lights and pass-throughs are cut in the field as required.

    * Air filtration and hardwall rooms:

      * Any Duroair filtration system or FFU can be paired with a hardwall enclosure.
    * Hardwall enclosure door options:

      * Barn doors, bifold doors, roll-up doors, man doors, etc.
    * Fire suppression available:

      * Both dry chemical and wet options are available for hardwall enclosures.

  - heading: Extra capacity and modularity
    description: >-
      * Up to 50’ high with unlimited width and length and can connect to an
      existing building and facility infrastructure.

      * Transforms into a self-supporting, modular clean room ready for mechanical assembly, 3D printing, electrical winding, or aerospace assembly and layup. Ideal for empty warehouses/facilities.
  - heading: Multiple clean rooms available in one structure
    description: >-
      * Ideal for rocket fairings assembly, engine valve assembly, and other
      processes where multiple rooms are needed for multiple processes to take
      place at the same time in a controlled environment.

      * Multiple rooms with different ISO levels are also available (ISO-classified clean rooms and hardwall clean rooms with different ISO classifications).
  - heading: More options for windows, pass-throughs, and doors
    description: >-
      * Accommodates multiple hard-wall pass-throughs and roll-up doors with
      easy-to-clean fabric for access ports. Allows items to pass through
      without having to exit and reenter the clean room, thereby de-risking
      contamination.

      * Multiple window types and thicknesses are available with door options that include airlock entries, man doors, rollup doors, and open face.
  - heading: Multiple roof, ceiling, and room options
    description: >-
      * Grid or structural roof panels with non-shedding ceiling tiles. A 3’’
      panel roof is available for an anteroom. Larger roof thickness is
      available for larger rooms. 

      * Explosion-proof and bullet-proof rooms are also available for maximum abrasiveness blasting.

  - heading: Customized lighting and brightness
    description: >-
      * Customizable for any type of recessed lighting, such as for 100-foot
      candles, with fixtures and ceiling panels in a grid structure. Additional
      options include troffer lights, panel lights with backlit and edge-lit
      options, C1D1, C1D2, and more.

      * Available in “bright white” color for high percentages of reflectivity. Additional colors are also available.

    description: >-
      * Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of 48 for a 30-40% noise
      reduction.

      * Additional noise reduction is available with tectum panels composed of aspen wood fibers and a hydraulic cement binder.
