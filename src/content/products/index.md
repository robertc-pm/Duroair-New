  headline: DuroRoom Portable Workstation
  copy: >-
    When off-the-shelf, portable paint booths or spray booths won’t cut it,
    DuroRoom™ delivers ready-to-deploy clean air for industrial-level
    manufacturing and maintenance.


    Pair DuroRoom with any of our industrial air cleaning systems into a portable workstation for:

    * Accommodating easy crane access, thanks to its retractability, which also allows more floor space when not in use.

    * Creating controlled environments for ISO clean rooms, painting and coating, dust collection, welding, additive manufacturing, and more.

    * Isolating, capturing, and containing any coating, grinding, sanding, and adhesive bonding airborne particulates, such as hexavalent chromium.
