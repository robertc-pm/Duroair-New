  ### Modular Aerospace Filtration Systems


  Ready to deploy when and where needed, Duroair modular enclosures and industrial air filtration for aerospace and aviation can be engineered to move with your cellular workflows. 


  Our retractable clean rooms with vented and non-vented air filtration systems are customizable to work with your unique production requirements.


  Aerospace and aviation clean air solutions include:


  * **Hexavalent chromium containment** and capture during sanding, coating, and painting operations

  * **Negative and positive pressure anterooms** to accompany cleanrooms and enclosures for painting and coating operations

  * **Modular multi-process clean rooms** with precise temperature and humidity controls that can be easily moved between locations and stored when not in use

  * **Dust collection systems** to effectively capture all particulates

  * **Oil mist containment and ambient air quality systems** to capture oil mist particles before they settle on valuable machinery and electronics

  quotation: The purchase of our Duroair system has allowed us to bring the
    coatings process in-house without permanently giving up our shop floor
    space. As a result, we have increased our customer responsiveness, as well
    as reduced our operating cost while providing a safe environment for our
    employees.

### Engineered Clean Air Solutions That Won’t Disrupt Your Lead Time

Aerospace and aviation metal finishing, coating and painting processes release toxic hexavalent chromium, isocyanates and VOCs into the air, often requiring clean rooms with precise temperature and humidity controls, as well as the need to isolate and capture contaminants via positive or negative pressure.

But, expensive permanent enclosures aren’t efficient for alternating between short-term production projects and long-term constructions. What if you had mobile aerospace filtration systems that you could quickly deploy for existing manufacturing cells as needed?
