### Engineered Industrial Air Cleaners That Won’t Disrupt Your Shop

Whether you’re cutting, welding, coating, grinding, or sanding, every metal fabrication task produces dust and fumes that can threaten your employees’ safety, derail productivity, increase maintenance costs, and place you in directly in the EPA’s crosshairs. 

Oil mist and dust particles can settle into every crack and crevice of your machinery, electronics, and cooling fans, eventually causing equipment failure and downtime.

Who has the time and resources to redesign an entire facility around a dedicated cleanroom or invest in a new HVAC system?  The answer is an industrial air cleaner that works with your current shop floor space to keep you in compliance with EHS requirements.
