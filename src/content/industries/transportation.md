  ### Modular Fume Extraction Systems For Limited Space


  Flexible enough for space-limited production cells and large enough to accommodate a transport trailer, bus, or rail car, Duroair’s modular industrial air filtration for transportation can be engineered to work with any shop floor configuration.


  Our [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) retractable enclosures and [DuroCap™](/products/durocap) vented or [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) non-vented, recirculating industrial air filtration systems bring safe, clean air to each work process without disrupting productivity. 


  Transportation clean air solutions include:


  * **Spray and paint booths with** **[DuroPure™](/products/duropure)** **non-vented filtration** that completely recycles air without the need to exhaust contaminants to the outside environment

  * **Surface prep stations with** **[DuroCap™](/products/durocap)** **vented air filtration** that filter out 99.4 percent of particulates and create a clean air envelope impervious to contamination from dust or dirty floors

  * **Four-stage filtration dust collectors ([DuroDust™](/products/durodust)) that go beyond OSHA compliance** to capture 100 percent of air particulates to 1.0 micron and 95 percent of particulates to 0.4 micron

  * **Portable clean rooms that can be customized to work with any of the above filtration systems** – each capable of retracting to less than 20 percent of its length

### Speed Up Drying Times with Compliant Clean Air

From alternating between initial paint sprays and repairs with finishing and coating applications, you’re too busy to worry if your shop floor air is OSHA or EPA compliant. You want to protect your employees against sanding dust and spray fumes, but facility-wide HVAC systems can suck the air out of your bottom line.

What if you had a cost-effective, clean fume extraction system that could protect your employees from airborne hazards and even speed up drying times for a more efficient work flow?
