  intro_desc: Welding toxic fumes and laser-cutting dust can threaten employee
    safety, derail productivity, and place you directly in the crosshairs of the
    EPA. Just a single spark can ignite welding “smoke” and endanger your entire
    shop floor. Welding contaminants can also reduce the life of your cooling
    fans and valuable CNC machinery.
