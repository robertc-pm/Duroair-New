    Additive manufacturing has the potential to help manufacturers minimize
    materials and energy usage, thereby reducing waste. Yet, for all the 3D
    excitement, there’s been very little public focus on the potential indoor
    air hazards of 3D printing at the industrial level, which can release
    volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and potentially toxic dust into the air.


    What if manufacturers had a proactive air filter for dust, to destroy these indoor air hazards *before* they’re released into a manufacturing facility?

  Duroair’s additive manufacturing clean air solutions provide:


  * Capacity for even large-scale 3D printing processes, when coupled with Duroair’s [modular enclosures](https://durocontent.netlify.app/products/duroroom) that can be custom-tailored for specific applications

  * Flexibility for crane access thanks to each enclosure’s retractability, that won’t interfere with current ventilation infrastructure

  * Mobility to move additive manufacturing processes when and where needed, without interrupting other cellular workflows

  * Protection for 3D printing integrity and quality, without contamination from corrosive dust and hazardous fumes

  ### Protect Your 3D Printing Operations With Air Filters For Dust


  Duroair can engineer industrial air filtration systems for specific additive manufacturing processes, such as prototyping aircraft components for aerospace and aviation. Armed with this technology, manufacturers can use 3D printing to innovate, without exposing facility employees to dust and gaseous particulates that can threaten safety and productivity.
