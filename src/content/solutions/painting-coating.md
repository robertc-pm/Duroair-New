  intro_head: Painting & Coating Requires Flexibility for Clean Air Control
  intro_desc: Flexibility is key to creating controlled, safe, and productive work
    environments during painting and coating for maintenance, repair, and
    operations (MRO). This is especially the case in high-mix/low-volume (HMLV)
    manufacturing environments where constant changes in workflows make it
    challenging to meet your indoor air quality requirements.

  Duroair’s painting and coating fume exhaust systems provide:


  * Faster drying times and improved overspray control with Duroair’s patented [Taper Draft Airflow Technology](/products/taper-draft-airflow-technology)

  * Efficient material handling with full use of overhead cranes for moving large workpieces 

  * Increased flexibility within a shop workspace for alternating between intermittent painting and coating processes and other operations

  * Optimized floor space utilization using our retractable enclosure, [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom),  for other revenue generating activities

  * 99.4% of airborne particulates captured with [DuroCap™](/products/durocap) vented solution

  * Unmatched employee protection with [DuroPure’s™](/products/duropure) high-efficiency, six-stage filtration process that captures 100% of airborne particulates, gases, and vapors
