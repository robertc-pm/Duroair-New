  Duroair’s oil mist collection and clean air solutions provide:


  * Increased productivity by preventing employee skin irritations, respiratory illnesses, and slip-and-fall accidents

  * Enhanced protection for your existing HVAC systems to prevent them from choking on oil mist particles and creating a foul, hazardous environment

  * Improved facility or plant image by eliminating the oil mist “haze” that can be unattractive to potential customers and visitors

  * Reduced man-hours by freeing employees from cleaning the oil and other impurities from machines and other shop floor equipment

  * Long-term ROI by extending the life of the electronics in your metalworking machines
