  of Duroair’s custom portable clean room design includes:


  * Reduced material handling by not having to transport large workpieces to a dedicated clean air space

  * Increased workflow efficiency for stop-and-start R&D processes

  * Eliminated need for expensive equipment and installation for air make-up

  * Laminar or turbulent airflow as required *Unsurpassed control of isolated work environments, including pressure (positive or negative), humidity, and temperature air flow patterns, and harmful dust particulates and gaseous contaminants

  ### Controlled, Clean-Air Work Spaces On-Demand Work Environments


  Duroair’s retractable clean rooms protect your people, help you meet OSHA and life safety requirements, and provide the flexibility to add and change workflows. These flexible, controlled environments move wherever they are needed. For example, with these flexible clean rooms, you don’t have to stop assembly lines to move a workpiece for painting or coating.


  How does this work? We combine a customized DuroRoom™ retractable enclosure with our DuroClean™ engineered exhaust system into one flexible, cost-effective solution for portable clean rooms and isolation rooms.


  Duroair modular clean rooms can be placed anywhere in a manufacturing facility without having to install supplementary ductwork — or pay for ongoing air make-up costs. Our portable, retractable enclosures with non-vented air filtration can be engineered for large or small self-contained work environments, wherever and whenever needed.


  Whether isolating a manufacturing process from the larger work environment (negative pressure) or protecting a process from contamination (positive pressure), our DuroRoom™ and engineered filtration systems help guarantee worker safety from toxic dust and fumes, while reducing operating expenses and increasing productivity.
