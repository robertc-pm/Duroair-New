  intro_head: Non-Destructive MPI and UV Testing Made Simple
  intro_desc: "Detecting metal surface flaws is no easy task, especially when
    you’re using magnetic particle inspections (MPIs), ultraviolet light (UV),
    or liquid penetrant testing to locate potentially dangerous particles not
    visible to the human eye. These precise, non-destructive testing procedures
    require a modular clean room: space that is large enough to work around
    hard-to-maneuver workpieces, yet is completely enclosed and light
    controlled."
