    Dust poses serious risks to both worker health and your entire facility.
    Grinding and blasting, cutting and sanding, and working with composites,
    metal, or stone produce a wide range of potentially hazardous dust that can
    compromise product quality and settle into every crook and crevice of your
    valuable machinery.


    Duroair can safeguard your employees and operations from dust exposure and help you go beyond OSHA compliance with our best-in-class industrial dust collection systems and filtration technology.
copy_block_list: All dust collection systems can be used with the
  [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom)  retractable enclosure to isolate and contain
  dust as the dust is generated – creating a safe and clean working environment
  within a larger space.

  ### Modular Dust Collection for Complete Protection


  Duroair offers four types of dust collection that can be customized by particle size (NESHAP 319 and HEPA) and the volume of dust generated to deliver the optimal protection for workers as required by OSHA:


  1. Duroair’s ambient dust collector, [DuroTower™](/products/durotower),  is designed for smoke, mist, and lower levels of dust found in a general shop environment. 

  2. Our recirculating system, [DuroDust™](/products/durodust), is engineered for moderate levels of dust production.

  3. Our vented solution, the [DuroCollector™](/products/durocollector), works for operations dealing with larger volumes of dust. 

  4. Our DuroTable™ is a custom down draft table complete with multi-stage filtration and custom table-top size.
