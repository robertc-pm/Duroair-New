  ### Modular Industrial Air Filtration Solutions for Military and Defense
  Manufacturing


  Duroair modular industrial air filtration systems for military and defense brings clean air to each rapid-moving manufacturing operation.  With a retractable [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) and vented or non-vented air filtration, each system can be engineered to accommodate large components for jets, MRAPs, or submarines, creating a cost-effective alternative to conventional systems.


  Military and defense OEM clean air solutions include:


  * **Repair and refinishing booths** with our [DuroCap™](/products/durocap), with [Taper Daft Airflow](/products/taper-draft-airflow-technology) technology that captures 99.4% of toxic dust from sanding and grinding tasks, often generated while working on paint from MRAPs

  * **Climate-controlled painting and coating rooms** in portable, retractable enclosures with [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) non-vented air filtration that easily move with grinding, painting, or sanding assignments and collect 100 percent of hexavalent chromium contaminants 

  * **Prototyping clean air booths** with retractable enclosures for overhead crane access and non-vented air filtration for self-contained security

  * **Special anterooms with HEPA filtration** designed to contain, capture, and collect particulates as operators move from inside a retractable enclosure to the general shop environment

  * **Down draft worktables** engineered to capture and collect contaminates generated while prepping, sanding, grinding, or cutting

    From U.S. military bases to military operations around the world,
    operational readiness depends on flexible, reliable maintenance, repair, and
    operations (MRO). But MRO tasks like sanding and painting can release
    dangerous, airborne hexavalent chromium and VOCs. How do you isolate and
    contain these threats while ensuring MRO flexibility?


    Fortunately, Duroair has created a new formula for clean-air flexibility by combining portable industrial air filtration technology with retractable enclosures. Our retractable enclosures isolate, contain, and protect processes as engineered filtration mitigates harmful contaminates for a compliant, tested, and verified clean air solution.


    Plus, Duroair's flexible, modular, and retractable solutions are more affordable than designated paint rooms and work spaces and move with military maintenance workflows. They're a cost-effective way to facility material handling challenges associated with coating operations, surface prep, mechanical assembly, isolation rooms, NDT, dust collection, and ISO clean rooms.

  sec_description: Between manufacturing, MRO, and prototyping, you don’t have
    time to rearrange your entire facility with the dedicated space and ductwork
    to shield your employees from airborne contaminates during sanding and
    painting. You need portable, clean-air solutions for the mission readiness,
    flexibility, and reliability required of your people and mission-critical
    equipment. Here are 10 ways Duroair supports mission readiness with portable
    containment and industrial air filtration systems.

        Duroair’s solutions meet stringent compliance requirements. The DuroPure six- stage filtration captures 99+% of particulates (exceeds NESAHP 319 requirements) and thoroughly cleans the air of VOCs, isocyanates, and hexavalent chromium. We work closely with EHS officers.

        Our systems are not only retractable; they also are on wheels. This allows for immediate repurposing of any area within a hangar or repair facility. The enclosures are deployable to another building or forward operating base (FOB), which means maximum productive flexibility and readiness.

        Since Duroair systems do not need to be permanently affixed to a building or facility, they provide agility to meet the demands of whatever work needs to be done. This is a big consideration for multi-phase work, such as corrosion protection in the humid environments of many bases.

        The unvented systems do not have to send treated air outside of the facility. They also do not require makeup air. This adds up to a substantial energy cost reduction in facility heating and cooling in comparison with solutions involving permanent setups.

        Duroair systems can be designed and built to any size requirements — an important consideration for servicing rotor blades, wings, engines, and large workpieces. The majority of specialized designs can be completed in weeks.

        A Duroair system allowed a military base to bring its prep work and painting in-house, saving millions of dollars and mission-critical time. Outsourcing can be a big cost for corrosion protection in the humid environments of many bases. With assets staying on site, it also saves on security costs associated with transit to a subcontractor.

        Large isolation booths with options for two or three chambers will allow multiple processes to be carried out at the same time on the same shift. This maximizes productive workspace and saves time).

        Our enclosures and systems can be designed to accommodate large components for jets, MRAPs, and even submarines. Whether you enclose a whole warfighter asset or specific sections such as wings to allow repairs without disassembly, workpieces can stay in place. This amounts to significant savings in repair time, material handling time, shipping time and costs, and scheduling time. It also minimizes moving damage and rework to sensitive and bulky workpieces.

        With our retractable, portable enclosures, there is no need to build new facilities for applications that require clean air. A Duroair system reduces capital cost investments by maximizing your productive space. It might allow you to repurpose existing structures. The booths are extended only when needed to isolate a process, and when isolation is no longer required, the enclosure can be retracted and the area can be returned to production. When not in use, the enclosure can be stored at about 20% of its extended length.
