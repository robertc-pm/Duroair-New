The [DuroRoom™](https://www.duroair.com/products/duroroom) is a portable controlled environment that can isolate and contain a wide variety of industrial processes. The DuroRoom can serve as a modular clean room, portable paint booth, and more. Additionally, when paired with one of our Duroair exhaust units, it captures and filters contaminants for an end-to-end clean air solution. The retractability of our controlled environments allows you to preserve valuable floor space when not in use, and allows for overhead crane access which offers considerable savings in material handling and labor costs.
