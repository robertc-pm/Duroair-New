### How Can Retractable Enclosures Meet Clean Air Requirements?


<p>Clean Air compliance is complicated, from meeting the concerns of environmental health and safety officers about air quality to local code requirements for equipment and facility operations. But clean air compliance doesn’t have to be a hassle. </p>
<p>
  
  Duroair has developed a patented air filtration system that works in a retractable enclosure without external venting for even the most hazardous air pollutants – hexavalent chromium, isocyanates and volatile organic compounds. This innovation brings clean air to large workpieces and reduces interruptions, saves costs and improves the bottom line. 
</p>
<p>
  
  This white paper identifies how portable, retractable industrial air filtration solutions are able to meet the most stringent OSHA and EPA compliance requirements and safeguard employees.
