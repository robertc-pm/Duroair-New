### Are Your Efforts to Mitigate Hexavalent Chromium Risks Draining Your Bottom Line?

From grinding and sanding to painting and coating, working with airplane and other aircraft metal components can lead to serious, long-term health threats from hexavalent chromium. PPE protects individuals performing these tasks, but reducing exposure facility-wide requires extensive man-hours and costly material handling.

But, what if you could isolate these processes to prevent ALL dangerous hexavalent chromium particulates from invading your facility?

This white paper explores the bottom-line impact of hexavalent chromium on aerospace manufacturing and how modular, industrial air filtration can cost-effectively mitigate these risks while improving production efficiency.
