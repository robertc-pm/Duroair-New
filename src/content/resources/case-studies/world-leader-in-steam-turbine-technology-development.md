situation: A world leader in the development and application of steam turbine
  technology was contracted to build six steam powered energy plants for an
  overseas customer. A key component in the manufacturing process was the
  application of a protective coating prior to final assembly and transportation
  for delivery. The onsite conventional fixed coating facility was located a
  significant distance away from the turbine manufacturing area in the sprawling
  plant layout. As a consequence, the coating process severely inhibited
  material flow and interfered with the use of five overhead cranes as the parts
  were moved to and from the fixed coating operation. The resulting increase in
  production cycle times and points of waste throughout the facility negatively
  impacted the plant’s bottom line.

  Duroair presented its modular designed retractable
  [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) enclosure that retracts to 20% of the extended
  length when not in use, thus optimizing the use of available floor space while
  improving product flow. The custom-size [DuroRoom™](/products/duropure) was
  combined with Duroair’s proprietary fully mobile, non-vented
  [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) indoor air purification system. Duroair’s
  solution-based approach of non-vented air filtration and retractable enclosure
  systems is uniquely designed to maximize product flow in finishing operations.


  [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) is the market leading, portable indoor air filtration and recycling unit that completely recycles and recirculates air without exhausting contaminants to the outside environment. This advanced air purification system is made possible through a patented, high-efficiency, six-stage filtration process to capture 100% of airborne particulates, as well as gases and vapours, resulting in thoroughly cleaned air that is well within OSHA’s allowable standards. [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) eliminates the need for outside venting, air make-up and its associated costs.


  The best equipment for an efficient plant layout can be easily disconnected from utilities and building infrastructure and moved as production needs dictate changes in plant floor layout. The Duroair solution provides point-of-use coating capabilities and is a critical component in waste reduction and optimizing cycle times.
results: The Duroair system installation of just two days avoided any
  significant downtime in production. Efficient material flow is achieved by
  inserting the Duroair system into the productions process when and where the
  coating application is required. Material handling with overhead cranes is no
  longer impeded and overall plant efficiency is maximized. The quick
  deployment, through plug-and-play capability of the Duroair solution, resulted
  in shortened production times while eliminating wasted motion. As a result of
  the positive experience with Duroair and overall performance of the system,
  the Six Sigma focused company now has plans to implement this solution in
  various locations throughout North America.
