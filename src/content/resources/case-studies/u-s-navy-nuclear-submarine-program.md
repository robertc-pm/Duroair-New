short_description: Portable air filtration solves submarine manufacturer's
  material handling challenges.
situation: The North American facility of a market leader in ship power
  solutions manufactures propulsion systems for the U.S. Navy’s nuclear
  submarine program. Due to the size and complexity of the systems, production
  is limited to a maximum of two systems per year. The component finishing
  process involves both abrasive blasting and paint and coatings, and only takes
  up about six weeks of the entire production process. Air make-up is available
  and material handling is performed by overhead cranes. A fixed metal enclosure
  with installed dust collectors and paint arrestors would require this
  enclosure to be equipped with a retractable roof opening to accommodate the
  overhead cranes. In addition, a permanent enclosure would reduce the usable
  floor space of the production facility.

solution: Duroair suggested the use of its fully portable, vented
  [DuroCap™](/products/durocap) indoor air purification system plus an
  interchangeable dust collection system in combination with a custom-designed
  [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) retractable enclosure. The
  [DuroCap™](/products/durocap) unit and the dust collector each provide optimal
  air handling capacity while the patented [Taper Draft Airflow
  Technology](/products/taper-draft-airflow-technology) improves drying times
  and optimizes overspray control. The [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) enclosure
  retracts to 20% of the extended length when not in use.
results: The result is efficient material flow via maneuvering components to the
  retracted enclosure, after which the enclosure is extended around the
  component prior to the finishing stage. Material handling with overhead cranes
  is not impeded while the use of existing floor space is maximized. While
  installation of a fixed metal enclosure requires about three weeks, the
  Duroair solution was up and running in just three days, resulting in a 10%
  reduction in capital costs and a 25% savings in installation costs.
