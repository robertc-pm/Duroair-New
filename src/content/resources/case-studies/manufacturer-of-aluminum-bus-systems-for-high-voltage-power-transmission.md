short_description: Flexible air filtration with crane access reduced lead times
  and increased capacity.
situation: A U.S.-based manufacturer of aluminum bus systems for high voltage
  power transmission could not meet increased demand for its products due to
  long lead times and inadequate capacity availability from the outsourced paint
  and coatings function. The costs associated with the outsourced supply also
  had a negative impact on margins. The alternative solution of bringing the
  paint and coatings function in-house was not viable because a conventional
  permanent enclosure required cost-prohibitive additional air make-up capacity,
  while the associated equipment and infrastructure would impede the use of
  overhead cranes at 30' (9.1 metres) height used for handling the 60' (18.3
  metres) long components. Due to the intermittent need for the paint and
  coatings function (one week each month), a permanent enclosure would reduce
  the usable existing floor/building space of the production facility.

solution: Duroair suggested its fully portable, non-vented DuroPure™ indoor air
  purification system in combination with a custom-designed DuroRoom™
  retractable enclosure. The DuroPure™ unit does not require air make-up and its
  air handling capacity is dictated by the area of the retractable enclosure,
  while the patented Tapered Airflow technology improves drying times and
  optimizes overspray control.
results: The fully integrated Duroair paint and coatings function results in
  dramatically reduced lead times, an increased capacity to meet product demand
  and superior finishing quality. Lower costs and shorter production cycles
  deliver an enhanced bottom line. Material handling with overhead cranes is not
  impeded while the use of existing floor space is maximized.
