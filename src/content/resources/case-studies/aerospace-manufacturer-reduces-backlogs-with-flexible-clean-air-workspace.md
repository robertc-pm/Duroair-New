short_description: Aerospace manufacturer uses an ingenious engineering design
  for clean air to triple its productivity for sanding and painting and reduce
  material handling.
situation: >-
  An aerospace manufacturer had an unusually large number of projects underway
  in the same facility, each of which required prep work, sanding and painting.
  With so many functions to perform, it was hard to balance the space needed at
  the same time for sanding and painting and the time required to get work done
  with the movement of work pieces. The result was a backlog of work for some
  functions. 




  The client needed more flexibility to paint and sand in the same area of the facility, and they needed more flexibility within that space.

solution: >-
  Duroair designed a solution with up to three clean-air chambers, each with its
  patented six-stage DuroPure™ air filtration system. These portable enclosures
  serve as an all-in-one sanding, coating and painting booth where workers
  simply change out filters for each task. 




  The retractable enclosure does not disrupt other adjacent manufacturing or maintenance operations or require additional space. The aerospace manufacturer can now perform up to three separate clean-air operations in the same area at the same time, which reduces interruptions, saves material handling costs and improves the bottom line. 


  This solution is compliant to OSHA, EPA and NESHAP industrial air quality standards for work involving hazardous air pollutants such as hexavalent chromium, isocyanates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The entire unit is retractable and can even be installed on wheels.

  The aerospace manufacturer has the potential to triple its productivity while
  reducing material handling. The flexibility provides opportunities to
  eliminate or reduce backlogs, especially since some functions require more
  time than others. The time saved quickly adds up.




  Among the flexibility realized:


  * The aerospace manufacturer can place an aircraft engine in each of the three chambers, and each engine can be prepped, sanded and painted in the same space, even if the adjacent chambers are being used for a different function at the same time. 

  * If the manufacturer wants to dedicate each chamber to a specific function, the workpiece is moved the shortest possible distance for the next function.

  * One or both of the interior walls can be removed to create a larger space to be used for a single function on a larger workpiece, such as a wing.
