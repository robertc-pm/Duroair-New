short_description: Climate-controlled clean room enables maneuverable aerospace prototyping.
situation: The North American R&D facility of a U.S.-based leading global
  security company builds prototypes of unmanned airborne systems for the
  purpose of testing and validation. Parts are produced in limited numbers
  throughout the fabricating shop. Component building process involves the use
  of adhesives that will only successfully bond within very specific temperature
  and humidity ranges that require climate control. In addition, the bonding
  process requires a clean room environment and has to be applied "in-place" at
  those shop locations where various components were being built. Conventional
  air make-up requirements don't allow for such a cellular fabricating model,
  while variable climate control in a fabricating environment is a delicate
  issue. Due to the intermittent need for the adhesive application function, a
  conventional clean room would reduce the usable existing floor space of the
  production facility.

solution: Duroair suggested the use of a unique, climate-controlled [clean
  room](https://www.duroair.com/technologies-solutions/clean-room-solutions/
  "Cleanroom Solutions") design that includes its portable, non-vented
  [DuroPure™](https://www.duroair.com/technologies-solutions/non-vented-air-recycling-filtration-solutions/
  "Non-Vented Air Recycling Filtration Solutions") indoor air purification
  system equipped with a Tier-sourced, climate control unit in combination with
  a custom-designed
  [DuroRoom™](https://www.duroair.com/technologies-solutions/retractable-enclosure-systems/
  "Retractable Enclosure Systems") retractable enclosure. The hybrid
  [DuroPure™](https://www.duroair.com/technologies-solutions/non-vented-air-recycling-filtration-solutions/
  "Non-Vented Air Recycling Filtration Solutions") unit delivers both a Class
  100,000 (ISO8) clean room environment plus required temperature and humidity
  control. The
  [DuroRoom™](https://www.duroair.com/technologies-solutions/retractable-enclosure-systems/
  "Retractable Enclosure Systems") enclosure retracts to 20% of the extended
  length when not in use.
results: Efficient material flow is accomplished by maneuvering the retracted
  Duroair [clean room](/solutions/clean-rooms) to the component after which the
  enclosure is extended around the component prior to the adhesive application.
  Temperature and humidity are efficiently and cost-effectively controlled while
  particulate and carbon filters provide required air quality. The use of
  existing floor space is maximized and no equipment and installation costs for
  air makeup are added.
