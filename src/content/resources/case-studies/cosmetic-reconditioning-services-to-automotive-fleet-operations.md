short_description: Portable clean air solution improves cost margins for
  automotive fleet operations.
situation: A U.S.-based world leader in providing cosmetic reconditioning
  services to automotive fleet operations such as rental agencies, lease
  management companies, and automotive auctions was looking to improve its
  margins. Its services are largely required on an "as needed" rather than an
  "as scheduled" basis in order to accommodate optimum vehicle availability.
  Said services are provided on location in either leased permanent facilities
  or semi-permanent metal enclosures. The costs associated with equipment
  teardown and relocation upon contract completion had a negative impact on
  margins, while long lead times prior to service availability restricted the
  number of contract opportunities.

solution: Duroair suggested the use of multiple fully portable
  [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) indoor air purification systems in combination
  with custom-designed [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) retractable enclosures.
  The [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) unit's air handling capacity is dictated
  by the area of the retractable enclosures, while the patented [Taper Draft
  Airflow Technology](/products/taper-draft-airflow-technology) improves drying
  times and optimizes overspray control. The compact, modular design of the unit
  makes it easy and affordable to ship by truck or to store for future use.
  Minimal installation requirements result in plug-and-use in as little as three
  hours.
results: The use of fully portable and affordably transportable Duroair
  solutions reduced relocation costs by $10,000 for each contract, delivering an
  enhanced bottom line. The company also enjoyed dramatically reduced lead
  times, minimal installation requirements and superior finish quality that
  resulted in an increased number of contract wins and improved cash flows, and
  overall preservation of their standing as a market leader.
