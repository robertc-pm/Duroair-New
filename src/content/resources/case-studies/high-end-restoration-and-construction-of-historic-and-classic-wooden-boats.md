short_description: Clean air solution enables cellular boat manufacturing in new facility.
situation: A U.S.-based company that specializes in high-end restoration and
  construction of historic and classic wooden boats was moving to a new shop
  that was designed to accommodate the workflow of hand-built operations. The
  painting and coating functions of the manufacturing process needed to be
  performed onsite and in an enclosed facility where various boat components
  were being built. Conventional air make-up doesn't allow for such a cellular
  manufacturing model, while dust control in a woodworking environment is a
  major issue. Plus, some of the finishes used on hand-crafted vessels require
  airflow to be supplied at very low volumes in order to ensure proper
  adherence.

solution: Duroair suggested the use of its patented, fully portable, non-vented
  [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) indoor air purification system in combination
  with a custom-designed [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) retractable enclosure
  that has swivel and lock casters installed so that the enclosure can be moved
  in any direction, and then locked into place for straight retraction and
  extension. The [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) unit does not require air
  makeup and its air handling capacity is dictated by the area of the
  retractable enclosure, while the patented [Taper Draft Airflow
  Technology](/products/taper-draft-airflow-technology) balances the air with
  horizontal tapered airflow that creates an "air envelope" impervious to
  contamination from dusty floors. All Duroair systems are equipped with
  Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) that provide complete control of required
  airflow so that any finishing conditions can be met. The
  [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) enclosure retracts to 20% of its extended
  length when not in use.
results: The Duroair system can be conveniently inserted into the cellular
  manufacturing model as needed. It provides the flexibility to produce a wide
  variety of lower volume components while maintaining the high productivity of
  larger-scale production. The finishing quality is uncompromised, while the use
  of existing floor space is maximized. Duroair provides the possibility of a
  historical craftsmanship environment within a financially viable business
  model.
