short_description: Engineered industrial air filtration clears the way for robotic welding safety.
situation: >-
  A North American weld shop needed a cost-effective way to isolate their
  robotic welding machine and contain the large clouds of indoor [weld
  smoke](/solutions/weld-smoke) that placed both employees and plant
  productivity at risk. PPE reduced respiratory threats, but did nothing to
  improve work area visibility.


  In addition to covering their OSHA and EPA bases, the company needed a clean air solution to:


  * Remove the need for PPE outside the welding area 

  * Shield workers outside the welding area from arc flashes that can damage eye corneas or ignite potentially flammable welding dust

  * Work within their limited amount of shop floor space

solution: >-
  Duroair engineered a custom industrial air filtration system that
  automatically extracted fumes and particulates from the robotic welding
  machine and then flooded safe, clean air back into the building. 


  This all-in-one clean air solution included:


  * Custom-designed [DurorRoom™](https://www.duroair.com/products/duroroom) enclosure that completely contained the welding machine in UV fabric to hide arc flashes 

  * [DuroTower™](/products/durotower) auto-adjusting plant cleaning system with redundant multi-layered filtering to contain weld smoke particulates

  * State-of-the-art air revolver system that is ten times more energy efficient than traditional overhead cleaners
results: >-
  Because the entire industrial air filtration solution only required a 10x10x15
  footprint, their workflows weren’t disrupted in the same building. Employees
  outside of the robotic machine enclosure no longer had to wear cumbersome PPE
  that inhibited productivity.


  Today, the system is still delivering ROI, including:


  * Improved workspace visibility, now clear from clouds of robotic welding smoke 

  * Safe, productive employees who are no longer at risk from arc flashes

  * [Reduced maintenance man-hours](/blog/improve-predictive-maintenance-profitability-with-modular-industrial-air-filtration) normally spent changing out costly HVAC filters
