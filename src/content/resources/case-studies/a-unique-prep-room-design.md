short_description: Modular air filtration solves R&D work-in-place and air makeup challenges.
situation: A North American research and development facility of a U.S. based
  market-leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and
  security systems, fabricates prototypes for the purpose of testing and
  validation. Parts are produced in limited numbers throughout the fabricating
  shop. The component finishing process involves both hand sanding of composite
  materials and coatings applications that are required on an intermittent basis
  and performed “in-place” and without an enclosure. After each sanding
  operation, composite dust settled throughout the entire facility requiring
  periodical cleaning of the entire shop floor at a cost of tens of thousands of
  dollars per cleaning. In addition, the coatings process required a paint
  arrestor for improved results. A permanent enclosure was not a viable solution
  due to the need to work "in-place" and the cost-prohibitive requirement for
  air makeup. A permanent enclosure would also reduce the usable existing floor
  space of the R&D facility.
solution: Duroair suggested the use of a unique prep room design that includes
  its patented, fully portable, non-vented [DuroPure™](/products/duropure)
  indoor air purification system equipped with self-cleaning dust filters and a
  dust collection system, in combination with a custom-designed
  [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) retractable enclosure. The hybrid
  [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) unit and the dust collector provides both air
  handling and dust filtration/collection, while
  [DuroPure™'s](/products/duropure) patented [Taper Draft Airflow
  Technology](/products/taper-draft-airflow-technology) improves drying times
  and optimizes overspray control during the coatings application. As an added
  benefit, the [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) enclosure retracts to 20% of the
  extended length, maximizing shop floor space when not in use.
results: The result of this solution is enhanced efficiency of material flow by
  installing the retracted Duroair prep room around the workpiece prior to the
  sanding and coating stages. Dust is effectively and cost-efficiently filtered
  and collected while the coating quality is optimized. The use of existing
  floor space is maximized. The investment in the Duroair prep room was
  recovered in just a few dust cleaning cycles and there were no equipment and
  installation costs for air makeup.
