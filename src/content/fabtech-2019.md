Metal fabrication workers face serious threats from hexavalent chromium and VOCs produced by welding, sanding, coating, and painting. Manufacturers have lacked options for mitigating these dangers facility-wide – until now.

Duroair’s six-stage filtration technology goes beyond NESHAP 319 requirements to isolate and capture 100% of dangerous hexavalent chromium particulates that threaten safety and productivity.

Learn how we can engineer a cost-effective solution to safeguard your manufacturing operations. **Schedule a free consultation at FABTECH 2019, and we’ll also send you a copy of our new white paper on the bottom-line impact of hexavalent chromium.**
