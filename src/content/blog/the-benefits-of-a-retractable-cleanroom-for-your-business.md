  Cleanrooms have come a long way with technological advances in filtration and innovative designs enabling manufacturers to increasingly satisfy the needs of those who depend on them.


  A multitude of industries have relied on cleanrooms for years as a way of maintaining a super clean, dirt and dust free environment. They have been especially useful for those in scientific research, biotechnology, and health sciences, to name just a few.


  In the manufacturing industry, cleanrooms play an important part when it is critical to maintain a purified environment for processes such as coating, painting, grinding and sanding. Industries such as aerospace, defence, metal fabrication and automotive benefit immensely from the features a cleanroom offers. With the ability to control aspects of the environment such as humidity, temperature, pressurization, airflow rates and particulate capture, users are in control of creating the ideal environment to address their needs.

  ### Why Retractable Cleanrooms?


  One of the most innovative advances in cleanrooms is the [retractable design](https://www.duroair.com/technologies-solutions/retractable-enclosure-systems/). With companies becoming more focused in creating lean, smart manufacturing environments, retractable cleanrooms offer benefits not previously available with conventional designs:


  * **Space Saving** – When use is intermittent, easily retract your [cleanroom enclosure](https://www.duroair.com/technologies-solutions/clean-room-solutions/) and continue to maximize your existing floor space for other purposes.

  * **Mobile** – When partnered with air re-circulating filtration, conventional venting is eliminated creating a completely mobile system. With the ability to relocate it whenever and wherever it’s needed, users ensure that they are operating at maximum efficiency.

  * **Eliminate Material Handling Challenges** – No longer is the material handling of large oversize parts a challenge. Simply pull the enclosure over your workpiece and commence operations.
