  The global industrial clean room market is booming, driven by regulatory standards, demands for higher quality in production, and increasing demand for contaminant-free products and packaging. The industrial ISO clean room market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4 percent from 2021 to 2028. But the sector also is expanding because industrial clean room providers have developed better and customizable modular solutions that are less expensive to install than a permanent clean room and offer more flexibility to the business.


  Duroair’s retractable [clean rooms](https://www.duroair.com/solutions/clean-rooms) are Class 1,000 compliant, which includes a range from ISO Class 9 to ISO Class 6. (ISO Class 1 is the highest standard, which is used for nanotechnology and ultra-fine particulate processing.) The clean room solutions can be placed anywhere in a manufacturing facility without having to install supplementary ductwork or pay for ongoing air make-up costs. The portable enclosures with non-vented air filtration can be engineered for large or small self-contained work environments, wherever and whenever needed. The [DuroRoom™](https://www.duroair.com/products/duroroom) retractable enclosure combines with our DuroClean™ engineered exhaust system into one flexible, cost-effective solution for on-demand clean rooms and isolation rooms.

  Duroair’s modular ISO clean rooms have been in use for many years in aerospace, defense, optical, and pharmaceutical production, and they are increasingly being used in automotive, biotech and food manufacturing and packaging. The industrial clean rooms are being used to carefully control the environment to increase safety, accuracy, product yield, and quality, while reducing adverse process outcomes.

  Here is a look at five industries driving the growth in industrial ISO clean rooms.


  ### Microelectronic Part Production for Devices, Displays and IOT


  The factories that manufacture microelectronics for increasingly larger flat panel displays and smaller personal devices boast some of the largest cleanrooms and are setting the bar high for controlling dust and chemical contamination. This helps drive the cost down for our favorite personal devices that keep us entertained and connected. Electronic clean rooms are usually within the ISO Class 1-to-6 range as they deal with static forces, electromagnetic interference, temperature, and humidity.


  ### Biotechnology Production for Medicines and Testing


  The biotechnology field includes biologic medicines (substances that people ingest into their bodies), testing and other consumables. The production work requires continuously handling sensitive fluids, organic matter, and live cells. The slightest contamination from any unwanted source can lead to decreased cell viability rates and inaccurate test results. Clean rooms in the biotechnology field often are specified from ISO Class 5-8.


  ### Pharmaceuticals and Life Sciences, From Devices to Vaccines


  The mass production of COVID-19 vaccines with little to no contamination would not have been possible without the industry’s historical experience using contaminate free clean rooms. Whether it is a medical device, hermetically sealed equipment, or on-going research, the pharmaceutical industry's use of cleanrooms can be attributed to many medical advances. Similar to biotechnology, the life sciences industry stores and manipulates fluids, chemicals and compounds that are highly sensitive to external contamination. Clean rooms in the life sciences field are also frequently rated from ISO Class 5-8.


  ### Food Manufacturing and Packaging Regulations


  Aseptic processing of food products requires manufacturers to adhere to stringent guidelines and government regulations that are only met through ISO standards. So the next time you pour milk over your cereal, remember that a clean room is helping to keep you safe and reducing the likelihood that our food products will lead to food borne illnesses. ISO classes for clean rooms in food processing and manufacturing differ widely.


  ### Automotive Circuitry and Computer Components


  Automobiles consist of sensitive circuitry and computer components that may be easily damaged by undesirable environmental conditions during the fabrication process. Clean rooms in the automotive industry are usually from ISO Class 6-9, depending on the part being manufactured.


  ### Industrial ISO Clean Rooms Are Good For Business


  Done properly, industrial ISO clean room systems are [good for business](https://www.duroair.com/blog/industrial-clean-rooms-101-what-you-need-to-get-started), producing a higher-quality environment for production. Whether isolating a manufacturing process from the larger work environment (negative pressure) or protecting a process from contamination (positive pressure), our DuroRoom™ and engineered filtration systems help guarantee worker safety from toxic dust and fumes, while reducing operating expenses, protecting equipment and increasing productivity.


  The benefits of our industrial ISO clean rooms include:


  * Increased workflow efficiency for stop-and-start R&D processes

  * Reduced material handling by not having to transport large workpieces to a dedicated clean air space

  * Eliminated need for expensive equipment and installation for air make-up

  * Laminar or turbulent airflow as required

  * Unsurpassed control of isolated work environments, including pressure (positive or negative), humidity, temperature air flow patterns, and harmful dust particulates and gaseous contaminants


  If we can assist you in putting a cleanroom to use in these or expanding your use of a cleanroom in other innovative ways, we’d love to talk. [Contact our industrial clean air experts](https://www.duroair.com/request-for-quote/) today for a free consultation.
