  The U.S. Department of Labor just announced a new OSHA compliance initiative to better protect workers from silica exposure in the engineered stone fabrication and installation industries. Duroair’s indoor air quality solutions can help you better protect your workers from silica health threats and help you stay in compliance with the new OSHA enforcement initiative.


  Our [industrial air filtration and dust collection systems](https://www.duroair.com/blog/custom-hard-wall-clean-room-solutions) are custom-engineered to address silica dust hazards. We can design a no-hassle, modular clean air solution to mitigate [silica dust exposure](https://www.duroair.com/industries/stone-cutting) from the manufacturing, finishing, and installing of natural and manufactured stone.


  See the press release below to learn more about OSHA’s new enforcement focus on industry employers to make sure they’re following required safety standards and providing workers with the protections required to keep them healthy in the stone fabrication industry.

  ### News Release


  ### DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ANNOUNCES ENFORCEMENT, COMPLIANCE INITIATIVE TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM SILICA EXPOSURE IN ENGINEERED STONE FABRICATION, INSTALLATION


  OSHA supplements current efforts to address serious workplace danger


  **WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of Labor announced that its Occupational Safety and Health Administration today launched [a new initiative focused on enhancing enforcement and providing compliance assistance](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2023-09-22) to protect workers in the engineered stone fabrication and installation industries.


  “Many workers in the engineered stone industry are experiencing illnesses so severe that they’re unable to breathe — much less work a full shift — because of their exposure to silica dust,” explained Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker. “Among them is a 27-year-old worker in California who went to an emergency room with shortness of breath in 2022 and whose lung biopsy later revealed he had silicosis. Since then, he has been on an oxygen tank and unable to support his wife and three young children financially.”


  Supplementing OSHA’s current National Emphasis Program for Respirable Crystalline Silica, this initiative will focus enforcement efforts on industry employers to make sure they’re following required safety standards and providing workers with the protections required to keep them healthy. It establishes procedures for prioritizing federal OSHA inspections to identify and ensure prompt abatement of hazards in covered industries where workers face exposure to high levels of silica dust.


  OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identify silica dust exposure as a health hazard for workers involved in manufacturing, finishing and installing natural and manufactured stone, which includes the man-made, engineered artificial or cultured types.


  When inhaled, very small crystalline silica particles expose workers to the risk of silicosis, an incurable, progressively disabling and sometimes fatal lung disease. Unsafe silica dust exposure can also lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or kidney disease.


  Industries subject to the prioritized programmed inspections include those engaged in Cut Stone and Stone Product Manufacturing as well as Brick, Stone and Related Construction Material Merchant Wholesalers. Outreach efforts will continue to include additional industries that may work with engineered stone.


  A July 2023 study released by the American Medical Association underscores the dangers for workers in these industries. The “[Silicosis Among Immigrant Engineered Stone Countertop Fabrication Workers in California](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2807615)” study cited 52 male patients diagnosed with silicosis caused by occupational exposure to respirable silica dust from engineered stone. Of these patients, 20 suffered progressive massive fibrosis, 11 needed lung transplants and 10 died due to their exposures.


  As part of the initiative, OSHA is sending affected employers and stakeholders information on the initiative, including fact sheets on dust control methods and safer work practices for engineered stone manufacturing, finishing and installation operations.
