Professionally produced products and parts will generally be judged by their finish. Next to the skill of the painters, the technical capabilities of the industrial spray booth is the biggest contributor to achieving a quality finish.

Whether concerned about dry times, cure quality, overspray control, or the challenges that come with using waterborne paints - [airflow technology](https://www.duroair.com/technologies-solutions/taper-draft-air-filtration-technology/) is a critical piece of the spray booth puzzle.

### The Challenges with Current Spray Booth Airflow Technology

Traditional downdraft and cross-draft technology have certain limitations that present quality, compliance, and productivity challenges — from preventing overspray collecting on workpieces to controlling moisture when working with waterborne paints.

Downdraft and cross-draft airflow technologies direct airflow into or across the workpiece surface, both of which are more likely to compound these challenges rather than mitigate them.

The specific challenges that cross-draft and downdraft present include:

* Limited ability to control odors created as a natural byproduct of finishing processes, which, if not properly dispersed, can lead to safety and productivity issues for both the painters and nearby workers
* Increased likelihood of contamination due to overspray being blown from one end of a spray booth to the other
* Poor humidity/moisture control
* Tendency to lift dirt and particulates from the shop floor and into curing paint (especially if the floor is not properly cleaned)
* Upfront capital expense to maintain efficient air makeup

### How Taper Draft Technology Can Improve Spray Booth Outcomes

Patented by Duroair, [taper draft airflow](https://www.duroair.com/technologies-solutions/taper-draft-air-filtration-technology/) provides innovative air purification technology. Industrial air filtration solutions using taper draft technology are capable of pulling high volumes of clean air through an intake filter.

Once inside the industrial spray booth, this high volume of air creates an envelope of air around the workpiece and continues to flow directly into the filter chamber.

Here are five distinct ways that an industrial spray booth equipped with taper draft can reduce operating costs and improve productivity:

1. **Improves drying times** — Taper draft technology’s air envelope creates a wicking effect that pulls moisture off of the piece. This reduces drying times between coats (particularly noticeable when using waterborne paints and coatings).
2. **Reduces the impact of dust and dirt** — Taper draft technology facilitates airflow in a pattern that doesn't pull floor dust or dirt onto the workpiece surface, delivering superior finishes, especially when compared to downdraft or cross-draft technology.
3. **Provides superior overspray control** — With taper draft, overspray is pulled swiftly and directly into the tapered filtration chamber, preventing it from settling on the workpiece itself or anything outside of the spray booth.
4. **Minimizes odors** — The air envelope created by taper draft technology creates a clean air chamber with less odor and contaminates, making it safer to work in.
5. **Offers improved air makeup management** — Taper draft technology properly balances air with horizontal airflow to create an air envelope impervious to contamination.
