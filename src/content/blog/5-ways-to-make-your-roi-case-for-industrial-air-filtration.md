  [Military maintenance and repair operations (MRO)](https://www.duroair.com/industries/defense/) often require processes that can expose service members to airborne hazards. From coating propeller blades to prevent corrosion to sanding and painting MRAPs for redeployment, these processes release extremely toxic chemicals into the air, most notably hexavalent chromium, isocyanates and VOCs.


  Not only can these chemicals make your service members ill, they can also interfere with the quality of the final build, potentially resulting in a mission-critical failure. Until recently, permanent clean rooms and paint booths were the only option to keep military service members safe during MRO. But permanent clean rooms and paint booths are difficult and time consuming to build, and may be impossible to install on deadline in military bases, hangars, and other forward operating bases.


  Duroair engineers customized clean air booths, equipped with [DuroPure™ industrial air filtration](https://www.duroair.com/products/duropure/) together with a flexible [DuroRoom™ retractable enclosure](https://www.duroair.com/products/duroroom/). These multi-purpose booths can provide the same safety benefits of a permanent clean room, while saving time and expense.

  Here are five ways that a Duroair multi-purpose booth can help you more cost-effectively optimize MRO, while protecting your service members during essential maintenance and repair tasks.


  ## 1. Reduce Military MRO Delays for Material Handling


  Military maintenance and repair operations, such as aircraft and aviation MRO, may require moving colossal machines and parts. Many of these workpieces are large enough to shut down an entire hangar or facility when in transit to a permanent clean room. Relocating a large workpiece like a cargo plane engine into a clean room requires extensive material handling time and resources.


  With a [portable multi-purpose booth](https://www.duroair.com/blog/multi-chamber-clean-air-booth-offers-space-efficiency-with-maximum-flexibility), you bring the clean air to the part or equipment rather than the other way around. Not only does this reduce material handling time, it also increases work safety and reduces labor needs, since portable clean air booths are easier to move than massive pieces of equipment.


  ## 2. Perform Simultaneous Multiple Maintenance & Repairs


  Portable clean air booths are superior to permanent rooms because they allow your team to [conduct multiple work activities at once](https://www.duroair.com/resources/case-studies/military-base-eliminates-outsourcing-of-surface-prep-work-painting/). Instead of having to sand, then paint, then coat, your team can potentially be completing all three stages at once on three different parts — utilizing Duroair portable booths. These booths also come equipped with filtration systems that make it easy to simply change out the DuroPure filters in each booth for each maintenance task.


  To allow work to proceed at a faster pace and prevent MRO bottlenecks, Duroair’s clean air booths [can be customized for up to three chambers](https://www.duroair.com/blog/multi-chamber-clean-air-booth-offers-space-efficiency-with-maximum-flexibility), to suit whatever work you need done at that moment in time. With this flexible clean air system, your team isn’t limited to a fixed clean room layout.


  ## 3. Reduce the Time for Maintenance and Repair Setup


  Permanent clean rooms and paint booths take time to design and install, and time is a luxury that military MRO teams do not have. Furthermore, installing a permanent system may simply not be an option in forward operating bases where the situation is constantly in flux.


  Duroair systems are ready to deploy at a moment’s notice, allowing service members to get started right away on MRO tasks. When not in use, the booths can retract to 20% of their extended length for easy storage. This also maximizes your hangar or facility space for mission readiness.


  This flexibility means that your maintenance and repairs can be completed on time and that your enlisted personnel will have the reliable equipment they need to carry out their directives.


  ## 4. Ensure Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Compliance


  There’s a common misconception that portable clean air booths cannot provide the same level of air filtration as a hard-walled room. Fortunately, DuroPure filtration has undergone third-party testing to verify contaminant levels fall far below OSHA allowable standards and accommodate MERV 15, HEPA or NESHAP 319 standards by capturing particulates to .03 microns.


  This patented, six-stage filtration captures 100% of airborne particulates, gasses and vapors. Meanwhile, the DuroRoom enclosure interlocks a fan, spray air and a VOC monitor all together, ensuring filtered air is recirculated within the enclosure. This eliminates the needs for venting, ducting and makeup air. Learn more about how our air filters and portable enclosures work together in our [six-stage filtration guide](https://www.duroair.com/blog/how-duropures-6-stage-industrial-air-filtration-system-works-in-a-portable-enclosure).


  ## 5. Increase Military MRO Safety & Equipment Reliability


  The most obvious benefit to a Duroair multi-purpose clean air booth is that it protects service members from the toxic chemicals involved in [military maintenance and repair operations](https://www.duroair.com/industries/defense/), such as aircraft and aviation MRO. Most importantly, these clean air systems improve MRO outcomes, such as anti-corrosion coating. In turn, military service members do not have to worry about equipment failure in the field, such as an aircraft propeller or cargo plane engine.


  Multi-purpose booths ensure that painting and coating applications dry properly by stopping dust and other air particulates from interfering with the curing process. If these coatings do not cure completely, corrosion can result in equipment failure. Equipment failure not only endangers the mission, it endangers the lives of enlisted men and women. Duroair clean air systems are a crucial part of corrosion prevention and ensuring that military equipment remains safe to operate.\

You don’t need regulatory watchdogs to tell you that assembly or finishing tasks can pose indoor air quality (IAQ) risks for your manufacturing employees. Welding, sanding, coating and painting tasks can release toxic dust and fumes containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that pose serious threats to your workers — and your production schedule.

Don’t wait until you’ve lost valuable hours and productivity to find a clean air solution. Duroair engineers portable, flexible [indoor air filtration systems](https://www.duroair.com/solutions/clean-rooms) that can isolate and safeguard assembly and finishing tasks, without disrupting your current cellular workflows. What’s more, there are definitive, bottom-line reasons that justify investing in a clean air solution. Here are some examples to take to your boss or stakeholders.

## 1: Costly Safety Threats

Working with aircraft or military machinery can be particularly hazardous due to hexavalent chromium that is often released into the air during sanding and coating. Hexavalent chromium and other VOCs are unfortunately necessary to make the coatings impervious to salt and moisture.

Aircraft corrosion from salt and moisture is an unacceptable risk for both military operations and commercial aerospace stakeholders. But risking employees to hexavalent chromium exposure is also an unacceptable risk. 

[According to OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/hexavalent_chromium.pdf), these health risks include: 

* **Dangers to the skin:** Brief skin contact can cause allergic swelling with a red, itchy rash, and repeated skin contact can result in a more severe, longer-lasting dermatitis. Contact with non-intact skin can even lead to chrome ulcers.
* **Dangers to the nose and throat:** Minor effects may include a runny nose, sneezing, coughing, or itching and burning sensations. Long-term exposure can increase the risk for nosebleeds, sores, or even perforations in the nasal septum (wall separating the nasal passages).
* **Dangers to the lungs and stomach:** While most people do not develop respiratory tract irritations from airborne hexavalent chromium, some employees can become allergic and develop asthma wheezing and shortness of breath. In extreme cases, workers can develop lung cancer or stomach conditions such as gastritis or gastrointestinal ulcers.

Even more alarming is the fact that unhealthy employees are more prone to making mistakes. Even a small mishap in the hanger or on the shop floor can put mission-critical operations or lives in peril. Additionally, you run the risk of regulatory fines, as OSHA requires all industries to take protective measures to shield their employees from hexavalent chromium exposure, per the [Chromium (VI) standard 1910.1026](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1026).

## 2: Downtime & Bottlenecks

Waiting and transport, two of the [“deadly wastes” of lean](https://www.duroair.com/blog/lean-modular-industrial-air-filtration), are often associated with sanding or painting large industrial workpieces, such as an electric turbine or a jet engine. Manufacturers are often forced to transport large pieces by dolly to move them into a separate bay. This type of movement may cause other workflows to temporarily stop, slowing work in progress (WIP).

For space-constrained facilities, all other workflows are often postponed until sanding and painting tasks are completed, further bottlenecking production timelines. Without an indoor clean air solution, manufacturers are often forced to:

* Require all workers not involved with finishing tasks to vacate the facility until the finishing process is complete.
* Air out the hanger or building after sanding, coating or painting, by opening all doors and windows.
* Transport large workpieces to a dedicated area, which requires extensive material handling and man-hours.
* Thoroughly clean areas where sanding and coating took place, to remove  particulates before starting a new task.

When time is money, even seemingly simple [finishing tasks](https://www.duroair.com/solutions/painting-coating) can become cost-prohibitive without efficient clean air solutions.

## 3: Operational Equipment Efficiency Risks

If you performed an OEE analysis today would your manufacturing facility make the grade? As noted earlier, airborne particulates from assembly and finishing tasks can cause other workflows to come to a grinding halt. In addition to safety threats, these contaminants can invade every nook and cranny of your valuable machining equipment or settle on recently painted or coated surfaces.

These indoor air OEE killers include:

* CNC machining oil mist that can compromise equipment sensors, circuits, and cooling fans.
* Equipment wear and tear from [particles shed from belts and hoses](https://www.robotics.org/content-detail.cfm/Industrial-Robotics-Editorials/Contamination-free-automation/content_id/9260) during robotic movement.
* Surface contamination of in-progress industrial workpieces, requiring rework and creating a cascade effect of production bottlenecks. 

Even worse, in high enough concentrations, [CNC machine dust](https://www.duroair.com/solutions/dust-collection) can become combustible, putting your entire facility at risk.

## 4: Predictive Maintenance Challenges

If you’re a shop floor or facility manager, you already know that proactive maintenance can prevent unplanned equipment outages, reduce labor costs for repairs, and ensure production efficiency. Predictive maintenance can reduce overall industrial maintenance costs by up to 30%, cut downtime by up to 45% and decrease breakdowns by more than 70%, according to the [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/omguide_complete.pdf).

However, excessive maintenance or cleaning (such as HVAC filter changes) can release free-floating contaminants that can contaminate machinery and corrode finishes and paints – threatening quality and reducing your maintenance ROI.

Maintenance tasks that produce airborne hazards include:

* HVAC filter changes: Filter changes dislodge dust, which can short out equipment motors, fuses, and other computer-controlled systems.
* Boiler work: Moving boiler piping often requires welding in areas not designated to control toxic oil mist and weld smoke.
* Facility painting: Even airless spray gun applications can result in overspray and odors/fumes that inhibit productivity.

## 5: Capital Investment Costs

From an F-16 aircraft wing to a GPS guidance system to a myriad of electronics devices, just a single mission-critical component can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to manufacture, store, ship, and assemble. As noted earlier, corrosion is a serious threat to components like these, as well as other quality and safety threats resulting from indoor air contaminants.

Duroair’s custom-engineered clean air solutions can help you safeguard your manufacturing processes — and your customers’ significant capital investments — from the tiniest avionics circuitry to the [largest cargo jet engines](https://www.duroair.com/industries/aerospace-aviation).

Employee safety, operational efficiency and high-value asset protection add up to bottom-line reasons to invest in industrial air filtration. If your operations depend on flexible, cellular manufacturing, Duroair’s modular, [multilayer filtration systems](https://www.duroair.com/products/duropure) can provide flexible, cost-effective, contamination control when and where you need it. Moreover, each of these systems require significantly less capital investment than most facility-wide filtration alternatives
