For work involving hazardous air pollutants such as hexavalent chromium, isocyanates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the ability to bring clean air to large spaces  has been a significant breakthrough for aerospace and defense contractors. 

These portable enclosures serve as an all-in-one sanding, coating and painting booth where workers simply change out filters for each task. The retractable enclosure does not disrupt other adjacent manufacturing or maintenance operations or require additional space. The solution reduces interruptions, saves material handling costs and improves the bottom line. 

Now, Duroair has taken its engineering ingenuity to a new level by designing a multi-chamber booth that accommodates up to three separate clean-air operations at the same time. This solution provides even more flexibility for manufacturers that must simultaneously manage multiple projects that all involve surface prep, sanding, painting and/or coating. 

## Duroair Adds Dimension of Flexibility to Industrial Air Filtration 

For aerospace and defense contractors, it can be difficult to balance the movements of work pieces, with so many different functions to perform, without creating backlogs somewhere in the process. They need flexibility to do surface prep, sand, paint and coat in the same space, ideally at the same time.

So Duroair designed a solution with up to three chambers, each with its patented [six-stage DuroPureTM air filtration system](https://www.duroair.com/products/duropure/). The three chambers can be used independently, or one or both of the interior walls can be removed so that one or two functions can be performed. The enclosure can be accessed from the front or side. While the example shown above is fixed, the entire unit can be retractable on wheels.

This is similar to how a meeting space at a hotel or convention center can be divided by partitions into a number of configurations of smaller rooms, only the Duroair solution is portable and compliant to OSHA, EPA and NESHAP industrial air quality standards.

## Multiple Chambers Provide Many Paths to Efficiencies 

The multi-chamber setup allows a manufacturer to easily work on multiple objects and processes at the same time.

Let’s say an aerospace contractor is manufacturing or maintaining multiple airplane engines that need surface prep, sanding and painting. Each engine would be placed into a chamber, and it could be prepped, sanded and painted in the same space, even if the adjacent chambers are being used for a different function at the same time. 

The aerospace manufacturer has the potential to triple their productivity while reducing material handling. If the manufacturer wants to dedicate each chamber to a specific function, the workpiece is moved the shortest possible distance for the next function.

The enclosure can easily be adjusted to be used for a single function on a larger workpiece, such as a wing, or split into two work areas.

The flexibility provides opportunities to eliminate or reduce backlogs, especially since some functions require more time than others. It also provides efficiencies that might be a tipping point for manufacturers to eliminate outsourcing of one or more functions.

## How the DuroPure™ Air Filtration System Works 

The patented six-stage DuroPure™ industrial air filtration technology for aerospace and defense contractors captures more than 99% of particulates and exceeds EPA and OSHA [requirements](https://www.duroair.com/about/beyond-compliance). The unvented recirculating solution does not require ducting or make-up air. The multi-layer filtration places less expensive filters in front of more expensive, technically-advanced filters to protect them and extend filter life. (Duroair has undergone intensive third-party testing to verify that toxic levels fall far below OSHA allowable standards. See test results [here](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/3114036/2021%20HVA%20Compliance%20Resources/DuroAir%20Total%20&%20Hexavalent%20Chromium%20Study.pdf).)

The flexible, clean air solutions cost less to build than a traditional system, which require a permanent footprint and venting – which can be costly, especially if a facility is at its EPA limit for exhaust stacks. Heating and cooling costs are reduced with non-vented units because air is not vented to the outside. Commissioning time also is greatly reduced – the Duroair solutions can be installed in days and weeks – not months.

The retractable multi-chamber enclosure can break down in hours to be stored at a fraction of its functioning space.
