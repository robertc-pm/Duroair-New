Our customer had a requirement to paint very large and heavy structural steel workpieces that were used in the flooring structure of the new World Trade Center towers in New York City.  By using their overhead crane to load these large workpieces into the Duroair [painting enclosure](/technologies-solutions/retractable-enclosure-systems/) they were able to maximize the efficiency of their operations and minimize the use of their valuable floor space.

Installing the Duroair system has also allowed this customer to address their concern about the health and safety of their valued employees during the painting process.
