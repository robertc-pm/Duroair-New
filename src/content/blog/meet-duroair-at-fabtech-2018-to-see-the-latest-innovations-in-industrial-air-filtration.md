  FABTECH is back! We’re more than pleased at Duroair to, once again, be a part of [FABTECH 2022](https://www.fabtechexpo.com/attend) — North America's largest metal fabrication event. The event is anticipated to attract thousands of visitors and well over 1,000 vendors to **Atlanta, Georgia from November 8-10, 2022**, with new, advanced manufacturing solutions for increasing productivity and efficiency.


  **Duroair will be located at booth #B5019**, where we will be showcasing our latest [modular air filtration innovations for metal fabricators](https://www.duroair.com/industries/metal-fabrication) that can significantly enhance safety, meet compliance, and maximize productivity during the coating, painting, grinding, and sanding processes.

  By combining flexible, non-vented air filtration systems with Duroair's retractable enclosures, metal fabricators can create a cost-effective clean air solution for painting and coating operations. Instead of a costly, permanent, paint booth construction, these modular clean air solutions save money by eliminating air make-up expenses and support lean manufacturing processes.


  **Visit our FABTECH Booth #B5019 and learn how our solutions can:**


  * Create fully compliant, modular clean rooms for contamination control.

  * Improve dry times, control overspray, and mitigate worker exposure during painting and coating processes.

  * Reduce capital expense and operating costs from installation and air make-up.

  * Bring clean air environments to large workpieces to reduce material handling bottlenecks and optimize floor space utilization.

  * Gain full use of overhead cranes for loading and unloading large workpieces from contained workspaces.


  To see how a Duroair solution can have a positive impact on both compliance and your bottom line, [schedule a free consultation](https://www.duroair.com/contact-us) with one of our clean air experts at FABTECH 2022.

We are once again pleased to [be a part of Fabtech 2018](http://air.duroair.com/fabtech-2018) — North America's largest metal forming, fabricating, welding, and finishing event. The event is anticipated to attract 35,000 visitors and 1,500 vendors to Atlanta, Georgia from November 6-8, 2018 and will include 650,000 square feet of exhibits and over 130 educational sessions.

**Duroair will be located** [**at booth #B4635**](http://air.duroair.com/fabtech-2018), where we will be showcasing our latest innovations in modular air filtration solutions for metal fabricators that significantly enhance safety, meet compliance, and maximize productivity during the coating, painting, grinding, and sanding processes.

By combining flexible non-vented air filtration systems with Duroair's innovative retractable enclosures, metal fabricators can create a cost-effective clean air solution for isolating manufacturing operations that won’t disrupt existing workflows, incur additional construction costs or ongoing air make-up expenses, and will support lean manufacturing practices.

With a Duroair solution, metal fabricators can:

- Create fully compliant, modular clean rooms for contamination control.
- Improve dry times, control overspray, and mitigate worker exposure during painting and coating processes.
- Reduce capital expense and operating costs from installation and air makeup.
- Bring clean air environments to large workpieces to reduce material handling bottlenecks and optimize floor space utilization.
- Gain full use of overhead cranes for loading and unloading large workpieces from contained workspaces.

FABTECH 2018 is also an opportunity for our team to [demonstrate our latest innovation in air filtration](http://air.duroair.com/fabtech-2018), a brand new, space-saving drop lock hinge system for our retractable enclosures.

Duroair enclosures are already a disruptive force in manufacturing, retracting to just 20% of their extended length for efficient storage when not in use. Now, our new hinge design takes this one step further.

When retracted, instead of the enclosure hinge moving laterally into shop space or into the enclosure space, the new enhanced drop lock hinges move vertically and have no impact on interior or exterior dimensions.

This is especially valuable for metal fabricators who have limited space and need a clean air solution that easily integrates with existing workflows and shop layout.

To learn how a Duroair solution can have a positive impact on both compliance and your bottom line, [schedule a free consultation](http://air.duroair.com/fabtech-2018) with one of our clean air experts at Fabtech 2018.
